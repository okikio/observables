/**
 * Defines the minimal contract for subscribable objects in the Observable ecosystem.
 * 
 * 
 * ObservableProtocol is the core interface that all Observable-like objects must
 * implement. It represents the object returned by `[Symbol.observable]()` that 
 * consumers actually call `.subscribe()` on.
 * 
 * This interface is designed for interoperability between different Observable
 * implementations, allowing libraries to work with any object that conforms to
 * this protocol.
 * 
 * In the TC39 proposal, this is the interface that the object returned by
 * `[Symbol.observable]()` must satisfy.
 * 
 * @typeParam T - Type of values emitted by this Observable.
 * 
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Example of an object implementing ObservableProtocol
 * const source: ObservableProtocol<number> = {
 *   subscribe(observer) {
 *     observer.next?.(1);
 *     observer.next?.(2);
 *     observer.complete?.();
 *     return { unsubscribe() {} };
 *   }
 * };
 * 
 * // Using the protocol
 * const subscription = source.subscribe({
 *   next: value => console.log(value)
 * });
 * ```
